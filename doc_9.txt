Example links, February 2017
How many distinct URLs are here?
../
../index.htm
http://lyle.smu.edu/~fmoore/index.htm
http://lyle.smu.edu/~fmoore/
http://lyle.smu.edu/~fmoore
Items 1 and 2 are relative URLs which must be resolved by the browser to an absolute URL.
Item 1 is the same as #4, and #2 is the same as #3.
Item 4 specifies a directory (i.e. the trailing slash notation).
Does the server permit directory listing?
Is there a default file to return (e.g. index.html)?
Item 5 appears to specify a file (with no extension).
The server attempts to return the file, but finds it as a directory.
Thus code 303 is generated before converting the "file" to a "directory" and processing it.
